<h4> My Story </h4>

"I started dancing when I was 7 years old. I fell in love with it, and since then,
<br>
I can't imagine my life without dancing. I became the European champion in all styles,
<br>
won the 2-face battle 14 times, and became a 16-time Swiss champion. I traveled the world, 
<br>
learning more about dancing. I used to have a dance school, but I realized that private lessons 
<br>
are better than having a school. Well, this is my story. Thanks for reading, and see you soon! Cheers."
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Initially, it was hard for me because I started with breakdancing. 
<br>
However, I switched to hip-hop when I couldn't do breakdance anymore. 
<br>
But now, I can move again, and everything is fine. Everybody is welcome—I don't really care about genders,
<br>
so don't worry. You are welcome, and I can come to your place,
<br> 
or we can arrange a location where we can dance together."

  Hey there,
<br>
  You know, when I step in front of the camera or hit the dance floor, it's like entering a world where my body becomes this living canvas, telling stories and expressing emotions without saying a word. It's not just about posing or moving—it's about becoming a storyteller.
 <br>
  In the world of modeling, I'm not just a face; I'm a storyteller capturing moments frozen in time, creating images that speak volumes. And when I dance, it's like my body becomes a living symphony. Each step, each twirl, is a celebration of passion and energy that I want to share with the world.
  <br>
  I see myself as more than just a model or dancer; I'm an architect of dreams. When I look in the mirror, I don't just see a reflection—I see a canvas waiting for my artistic touch. It's about embracing every movement, finding strength in my poses, and letting my authenticity shine through.
  <br>
  This journey isn't just about performances; it's about creating and telling stories that resonate. Every twist and turn adds depth to my artistry, making the whole experience a kaleidoscope of vibrant, unique moments.
  <br>
  So, you know, it's not just about the poses or dance routines; it's about being a creator, a storyteller, and hopefully, an inspiration for those who get a glimpse of the magic I'm bringing to life. I'm dancing on, modeling boldly, and painting the world with the colors of my passion. Join me in this journey, won't you?
